- Small parrots (budgies, cockatiels): ½ inch bar spacing, 18x18x24 inch cage minimum
- Medium parrots (conures, amazons): ¾ inch bar spacing, 24x24x36 inch minimum
- Large parrots (macaws, large amazons): 1-1.5 inch bar spacing, 36x48x60 inch minimum

Essential cage features: horizontal bars for climbing, multiple perches of varying diameter,
food/water bowls, foraging toys, and a sleep cover. Place cage at eye level, away from drafts,
kitchen fumes (Teflon is FATAL to birds), and direct sunlight.""",

    "enrichment": """Parrots need 3-4 hours of out-of-cage time daily plus mental stimulation:
- Foraging toys: hide food in wrapping paper, puzzle feeders, shreddable toys
- Rotate toys weekly to prevent boredom
- Training sessions: 10-15 minutes twice daily using positive reinforcement only
- Social interaction: talk to your bird, include them in family activities
- Music and nature sounds can be enriching
- Provide chewing materials: safe wood blocks, palm fronds, willow branches
- Foot toys for in-cage play""",

    "health": """Signs your parrot needs a vet immediately:
- Fluffed feathers + lethargy (birds hide illness — this is serious)
- Discharge from eyes or nostrils
- Tail bobbing while breathing
- Changes in droppings (color, consistency, volume)
- Loss of appetite > 24 hours
- Bleeding

Routine care:
- Annual avian vet checkup (find an avian specialist, not a general vet)
- Nail and beak trims as needed
- Bathing 2-3x per week (misting, shallow dish, or shower perch)
- Full-spectrum lighting 10-12 hours daily for vitamin D synthesis""",

    "socialization": """Parrots are flock animals — isolation causes serious psychological damage.
- New bird: quarantine 30 days if you have other birds
- Taming: start with hand-feeding treats, progress to step-up training
- Never punish — only positive reinforcement
- Respect body language: pinned pupils + fanned tail = overstimulated, back off
- Social needs vary by species: African Greys may prefer one person; conures want constant attention
- Consider getting two if you work full-time — loneliness causes feather destructive behavior""",
